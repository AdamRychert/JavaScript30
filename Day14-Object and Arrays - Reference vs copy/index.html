        console.log(age, age2);

        const playersCopy = players;
        console.log(playersCopy);
        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        playersCopy[3] = "Luxi";    //Work similar to pointers in C (or so i think). it's a refrence to players so both will change
        // however what happens when we update that array?

        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        //My way that I think will work(before watching)
        console.clear();
        const playersCopy2 = [...players];  //WORKS!!!
        playersCopy2[3] = "Adam";
        console.log(players);
        console.clear();
        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice();  //without any param. slice will copy whole array
        //OR

        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);

        // or use the new ES6 Spread    (AS I DID YEY!)
        const team4 = [...players];


        //OR

        const team5 = Array.from(players);

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person; //again it's a refrence
        captain.number = 99;
        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 199 });    //!!!!!!!!WORKS ONLY 1 LVL DEPP WTF D:

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread      //IT WORKS FOR NOW D:
        const cap3 = { ...person };
        console.log(cap3);
        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
        const Adam = {
            name: "Adam",
            age: 21,
            social: {
                facebook: "none",
                more: {
                    taken: ["yes", true]
                }
            }
        }
        const Adam2 = { ...Adam };  //works for nested as well D:
        console.log(Adam2);
        const Adam3 = Object.assign({}, Adam);
        Adam3.social.more.taken[0] = "NO";
        console.log(Adam);  //CHANGED TO NO !!!
        Adam2.social.more.taken[0] = "YES"; //CHANGED THE MAIN OBJECT AS WELL :C
